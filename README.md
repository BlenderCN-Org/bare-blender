# bare-blender

This project aims to create a bare-bones blender application. There are a number of reasons for this project.

  * It's fun
  * I would like to learn more about the internals of blender this way
  * I want to learn more about C and C++
  * I would like to make a skeleton app that can be used for other applications as a starting point in the future
